> **Released checkpoint scope:** SenseVoiceSmall supports ASR and language ID for Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Japanese, and Korean, together with emotion and audio-event tags. Speaker diarization is a composed FunASR pipeline using separate FSMN-VAD and CAM++ models; it is not an output of the SenseVoiceSmall checkpoint itself.


<a name="Highligts"></a>
# Highlights 🎯
**SenseVoice** focuses on high-accuracy multilingual speech recognition, speech emotion recognition, and audio event detection.
- **Research scope vs released checkpoint:** The broader SenseVoice work reports training on more than 400,000 hours and support for more than 50 languages. The released SenseVoiceSmall checkpoint linked above supports Mandarin, Cantonese, English, Japanese, and Korean; the benchmark comparisons below are task- and language-specific.
- **Rich transcribe:** 
  - Possess excellent emotion recognition capabilities, achieving and surpassing the effectiveness of the current best emotion recognition models on test data.
  - Offer sound event detection capabilities, supporting the detection of various common human-computer interaction events such as bgm, applause, laughter, crying, coughing, and sneezing.
- **Efficient Inference:** SenseVoiceSmall uses a non-autoregressive end-to-end framework for low-latency inference; see the benchmark setup and comparison below.
- **Convenient Finetuning:** Provide convenient finetuning scripts and strategies, allowing users to easily address long-tail sample issues according to their business scenarios.
- **Service Deployment:** Offer service deployment pipeline,  supporting multi-concurrent requests, with client-side languages including Python, C++, HTML, Java, and C#, among others.

<a name="What's News"></a>
# What's New 🔥
- **Current deployment path:** install `funasr==1.4.14` for SenseVoice Python, OpenAI-compatible service, and container workflows. [Release notes](https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR/releases/tag/v1.4.14) · [SenseVoice releases](https://github.com/QwenAudio/SenseVoice/releases)
- **Long audio without VAD:** `long_audio_no_vad.py` uses bounded overlapping windows and preserves raw chunk outputs, so hour-scale recordings do not require one unbounded GPU allocation. [Run it ->](./long_audio_no_vad.py)
- **Integrated diarization alternative:** the wider FunASR ecosystem supports OpenMOSS/MOSS-Transcribe-Diarize for offline transcription, timestamps, and anonymous speaker labels without composing external VAD and speaker models. [Deployment guide ->](https://www.funasr.com/en/deploy/moss-transcribe-diarize.html)

# Benchmarks 📝

## Multilingual Speech Recognition
We compared the performance of multilingual speech recognition between SenseVoice and Whisper on open-source benchmark datasets, including AISHELL-1, AISHELL-2, Wenetspeech, LibriSpeech, and Common Voice. In terms of Chinese and Cantonese recognition, the SenseVoice-Small model has advantages.

<div align="center">  
<img src="image/asr_results1.png" width="400" /><img src="image/asr_results2.png" width="400" />
</div>

## Speech Emotion Recognition

Due to the current lack of widely-used benchmarks and methods for speech emotion recognition, we conducted evaluations across various metrics on multiple test sets and performed a comprehensive comparison with numerous results from recent benchmarks. The selected test sets encompass data in both Chinese and English, and include multiple styles such as performances, films, and natural conversations. Without finetuning on the target data, SenseVoice was able to achieve and exceed the performance of the current best speech emotion recognition models.

For a reproducible zero-shot CASIA or RAVDESS rerun, use the [SER evaluation contract](./benchmarks/ser/README.md). It reads the raw SenseVoice emotion tag and reports both UA and WA instead of deriving labels from formatted transcription text.

<div align="center">  
<img src="image/ser_table.png" width="1000" />
</div>

Furthermore, we compared multiple open-source speech emotion recognition models on the test sets, and the results indicate that the SenseVoice-Large model achieved the best performance on nearly all datasets, while the SenseVoice-Small model also surpassed other open-source models on the majority of the datasets.

<div align="center">  
<img src="image/ser_figure.png" width="500" />
</div>

## Audio Event Detection

Although trained exclusively on speech data, SenseVoice can still function as a standalone event detection model. We compared its performance on the environmental sound classification ESC-50 dataset against the widely used industry models BEATS and PANN. The SenseVoice model achieved commendable results on these tasks. However, due to limitations in training data and methodology, its event classification performance has some gaps compared to specialized AED models.

<div align="center">  
<img src="image/aed_figure.png" width="500" />
</div>

## Computational  Efficiency

In the benchmark setup shown below, SenseVoiceSmall uses a non-autoregressive end-to-end architecture and, at a similar parameter count, runs more than 5 times faster than Whisper-Small and 15 times faster than Whisper-Large.

# Requirements

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

SenseVoiceSmall examples and the composed FunASR diarization path require `funasr>=1.3.26`. If you installed this repository earlier, run `pip install -U "funasr>=1.3.26"` before retrying the demos.

<a name="Usage"></a>
# Usage

## Inference

Supports common audio formats. Long recordings must be segmented before they are
sent to the encoder; the example below uses FSMN-VAD for that segmentation.

```python
from funasr import AutoModel
from funasr.utils.postprocess_utils import rich_transcription_postprocess

model_dir = "iic/SenseVoiceSmall"


model = AutoModel(
    model=model_dir,
    trust_remote_code=True,
    remote_code="./model.py",    
    vad_model="fsmn-vad",
    vad_kwargs={"max_single_segment_time": 30000},
    device="cuda:0",
)

# en
res = model.generate(
    input=f"{model.model_path}/example/en.mp3",
    cache={},
    language="auto",  # "zh", "en", "yue", "ja", "ko", "nospeech"
    use_itn=True,
    batch_size_s=60,
    merge_vad=True,  #
    merge_length_s=15,
)
text = rich_transcription_postprocess(res[0]["text"])
print(text)
```

<details><summary>Parameter Description (Click to Expand)</summary>

- `model_dir`: The name of the model, or the path to the model on the local disk.
- `trust_remote_code`:
  - When `True`, it means that the model's code implementation is loaded from `remote_code`, which specifies the exact location of the `model` code (for example, `model.py` in the current directory). It supports absolute paths, relative paths, and network URLs.
  - When `False`, it indicates that the model's code implementation is the integrated version within [FunASR](https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR). At this time, modifications made to `model.py` in the current directory will not be effective, as the version loaded is the internal one from FunASR. For the model code, [click here to view](https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR/tree/main/funasr/models/sense_voice).
- `vad_model`: This indicates the activation of VAD (Voice Activity Detection). The purpose of VAD is to split long audio into shorter clips. In this case, the inference time includes both VAD and SenseVoice total consumption, and represents the end-to-end latency. If you wish to test the SenseVoice model's inference time separately, the VAD model can be disabled.
- `vad_kwargs`: Specifies the configurations for the VAD model. `max_single_segment_time`: denotes the maximum duration for audio segmentation by the `vad_model`, with the unit being milliseconds (ms).
- `use_itn`: Whether the output result includes punctuation and inverse text normalization.
- `batch_size_s`: Indicates the use of dynamic batching, where the total duration of audio in the batch is measured in seconds (s).
- `merge_vad`: Whether to merge short audio fragments segmented by the VAD model, with the merged length being `merge_length_s`, in seconds (s).
- `ban_emo_unk`: Whether to ban the output of the `emo_unk` token.
</details>

### Long audio without VAD

Passing an hour-long waveform to one `model.generate` call can make encoder
memory grow far beyond the audio file size. When VAD is not acceptable, use the
bounded-memory reference script instead. It decodes through ffmpeg, runs
SenseVoice on fixed 30-second windows with 2 seconds of overlap, and does not
configure a VAD model:

```bash
python long_audio_no_vad.py meeting.mp3 \
  --output meeting.txt \
  --window-seconds 30 \
  --overlap-seconds 2
```

The merged transcript removes only exact text repeated across adjacent window
boundaries. `meeting.chunks.jsonl` retains every raw model response and window
offset, so nonmatching output is never silently discarded; pass `--no-dedupe`
to disable even exact-overlap removal. Window offsets describe input boundaries,
not word timestamps. This path avoids whole-recording encoder OOM, but fixed
boundaries can still change recognition around a cut. The VAD pipeline above
remains the recommended default when content-based segmentation is acceptable.

### Speaker Diarization

This example composes SenseVoiceSmall with separate FSMN-VAD, CAM++, and punctuation models through FunASR. CAM++ provides the speaker labels; the SenseVoiceSmall checkpoint itself does not:

```python
from funasr import AutoModel
from funasr.utils.postprocess_utils import rich_transcription_postprocess

model = AutoModel(
    model="iic/SenseVoiceSmall",
    trust_remote_code=True,
    remote_code="./model.py",
    vad_model="fsmn-vad",
    vad_kwargs={"max_single_segment_time": 30000},
    spk_model="cam++",
    punc_model="ct-punc",
    device="cuda:0",
)
res = model.generate(
    input="example.wav",
    cache={},
    language="auto",
    use_itn=True,
    batch_size_s=60,
    merge_vad=True,
    merge_length_s=15,
)
# Per-sentence results with speaker labels
for sent in res[0]["sentence_info"]:
    text = rich_transcription_postprocess(sent["text"])
    print(f"Speaker {sent['spk']}: [{sent['start']}ms - {sent['end']}ms] {text}")
```

> Note: Requires installing FunASR from source: `pip install git+https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR.git`

If all inputs are short audios (<30s), and batch inference is needed to speed up inference efficiency, the VAD model can be removed, and `batch_size` can be set accordingly.
```python
model = AutoModel(model=model_dir, trust_remote_code=True, device="cuda:0")

res = model.generate(
    input=f"{model.model_path}/example/en.mp3",
    cache={},
    language="zh", # "zh", "en", "yue", "ja", "ko", "nospeech"
    use_itn=False,
    batch_size=64, 
)
```

For more usage, please refer to [docs](https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR/blob/main/docs/tutorial/README.md)

### Inference directly

Supports input of audio in any format, with an input duration limit of 30 seconds or less.

```python
from model import SenseVoiceSmall
from funasr.utils.postprocess_utils import rich_transcription_postprocess

model_dir = "iic/SenseVoiceSmall"
m, kwargs = SenseVoiceSmall.from_pretrained(model=model_dir, device="cuda:0")
m.eval()

res = m.inference(
    data_in=f"{kwargs['model_path']}/example/en.mp3",
    language="auto", # "zh", "en", "yue", "ja", "ko", "nospeech"
    use_itn=False,
    ban_emo_unk=False,
    **kwargs,
)

text = rich_transcription_postprocess(res[0][0]["text"])
print(text)
```

### Run on CPU / edge — llama.cpp / GGUF (no GPU, no Python)

Run SenseVoice as a **single self-contained binary** — this is to SenseVoice what [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp) is to Whisper, but with far stronger Chinese & Cantonese accuracy. Built-in FSMN-VAD, no Python at runtime.

```bash
bash runtime/llama.cpp/download-funasr-model.sh sensevoice ./gguf
llama-funasr-sensevoice -m ./gguf/sensevoice-small-f16.gguf --vad ./gguf/fsmn-vad.gguf -a audio.wav
```

**Prebuilt binaries:** [Releases](https://github.com/QwenAudio/SenseVoice/releases) · **Download & quickstart:** [funasr.com/llama-cpp](https://www.funasr.com/llama-cpp.html) · **GGUF:** [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/FunAudioLLM/SenseVoiceSmall-GGUF) · **Docs & benchmarks:** [runtime/llama.cpp/](./runtime/llama.cpp/)

## Service

### Deployment with FastAPI
```shell
export SENSEVOICE_DEVICE=cuda:0
fastapi run --port 50000
```

## Finetune

### Requirements

```shell
git clone https://github.com/modelscope/FunASR.git && cd FunASR
pip3 install -e ./
```
## 🐳 Docker Support

SenseVoice can be built and run using Docker to simplify setup, ensure reproducibility, and support both CPU and GPU inference.

### Build with Docker
```bash
docker build -t sensevoice .
```

> The build workflow also publishes `ghcr.io/qwenaudio/sensevoice`, but the
> package is currently private and anonymous pulls return HTTP 401. Use the
> local build above until the [container package](https://github.com/QwenAudio/SenseVoice/pkgs/container/sensevoice)
> is marked Public.

### Run (GPU – default)
```bash
docker run --rm --gpus all -p 50000:50000 -v sensevoice-models:/models sensevoice
```
### Run (CPU-only)
```bash
docker run --rm -e SENSEVOICE_DEVICE=cpu -p 50000:50000 -v sensevoice-models:/models sensevoice
```

The container listens on port 50000. After it is healthy, open `http://127.0.0.1:50000/docs`.

### Docker Compose
Docker Compose builds the same image and keeps the model cache on the `sensevoice-models` volume. The default compose file does not request GPUs, so it starts on CPU hosts. For GPU, use the `docker run --gpus all` command above.

### Start Stack
```bash
docker compose up --build
# CPU is the default. Equivalent: SENSEVOICE_DEVICE=cpu docker compose up --build
```
